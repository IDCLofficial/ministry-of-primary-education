              The Imo State Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has taken decisive action by revoking licenses and approvals of private schools operating in residential apartments and non-designated housing estates across the state.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The Ministry declared that such schools pose safety risks and fail to meet the minimum standards set for approved learning environments. Parents have been strongly advised to re-enroll their children in officially sanctioned institutions to ensure quality education and student welfare.

              The Ministry has reiterated its commitment to monitoring compliance and working closely with education stakeholders to raise the standard of learning in the state. This move is part of a broader reform to sanitize the sector and restore public confidence in private education delivery.

              A dedicated task force has been deployed to enforce these measures and conduct ongoing inspections of school facilities across all local government areas.
