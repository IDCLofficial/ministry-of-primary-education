# Student Portal - New Exam Selection Flow

## Overview
The student portal has been restructured so that students **select their examination type FIRST**, before entering any login credentials. This provides a cleaner, more intuitive user experience.

## New User Flow

### 1. Landing Page (`/student-portal`)
**First Impression - Exam Selection**
- Beautiful, sleek landing page with animated gradient background
- Two large, interactive cards for BECE and UBEAT
- Hover effects with scale and glow animations
- Clear visual indicators for available vs coming soon exams
- "Coming Soon" badge for UBEAT
- Responsive design (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop)

### 2. Exam-Specific Login (`/student-portal/bece` or `/student-portal/ubeat`)
**After Selecting Exam Type**
- Dedicated login page for each examination type
- BECE branding with green colors and "Active" badge
- Back button to return to exam selection
- Exam number validation specific to that exam type
- Stores both exam number AND exam type in localStorage

### 3. Results Dashboard (`/student-portal/dashboard`)
**After Successful Login**
- Displays results for the selected exam type
- Exam-specific branding and colors
- Badge showing current exam type
- "Change Exam" button to switch between exams
- Download, print, and logout options

## Key Improvements

```
**Benefits:**

📱 **Responsive:**

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
/student-portal/
├── page.tsx                  # Landing page (exam selection)
├── bece/
│   └── page.tsx             # BECE login page
├── ubeat/
│   └── page.tsx             # UBEAT login page (future)
├── dashboard/
│   └── page.tsx             # Results dashboard
└── EXAM_SELECTION_README.md # Documentation
```

### LocalStorage Keys
| Key | Value | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `selected_exam_type` | `'bece'` or `'ubeat'` | Tracks which exam was selected |
| `student_exam_no` | Exam number string | Student's exam number |
| `student_data` | JSON object | Complete student data |

### Routing Logic
```typescript
// Landing page checks no redirect needed - it's the entry point

// Login pages store exam type:
localStorage.setItem('selected_exam_type', 'bece')

// Dashboard validates:
if (!localStorage.getItem('selected_exam_type')) {
    router.push('/student-portal') // Back to landing
}
```

## User Experience Enhancements

- ✅ Success/error messages
- ✅ Active state indicators
- ✅ Disabled state for unavailable exams

### 2. Navigation
- ✅ Back button on login pages

- ✅ Clear breadcrumb trail
- ✅ Logout returns to landing page

### 3. Accessibility
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Focus states
- ✅ ARIA labels
- ✅ High contrast text
- ✅ Touch-friendly targets (48px minimum)
